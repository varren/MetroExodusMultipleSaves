Can download the app here: https://github.com/varren/MetroExodusMultipleSaves/releases/tag/v0.1

Works only on `Windows`. And it is raw version. Made it in a couple of hours. Bugs can occur, so don't rely to much on it. Requires `Java 8`. If you don't want to download the exe file, just download the full source code and compile it.

WARNING: "restart game" will close the game without saving current game.
WARNING: "restart game" and "load" will remove your current saves,, both quicksave and autosave.

Known issues: Screens work only if you play in windowed mode and not in full screen
To turn windowed mode on you have to edit this file:
`%HOMEPATH%\Saved Games\metro exodus\user.cfg` and change `r_fullscreen off`
